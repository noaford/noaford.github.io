I received a PhD in Applied Math from Northwestern University in 2020. I worked with [David Chopp](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/chopp-david.html) on problems in scientific computing, simulations, and high performance computing as they related to biofilm, communties of immobile bacteria that live on surfaces.

Since graduating, I've tranistioned to simulating autonomous systems instead of bacteria. I've led several projects to create new machine-learning-based tools to evaluate autonomies. Increasing model capabilities are driving exciting changes in this field. It's been fun to learn about these models and to try to improve our understanding of how autonomous systems work.
