I'm an a PhD candidate in applied math at Northwestern University. I work with [David Chopp](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/chopp-david.html) on problems in scientific computing, simulations, and high performance computing as they related to biofilm, communties of immobile bacteria that live on surfaces.

Problems I find interesting include modeling, building simulations, parallel computing, uncertainty quantification, and data assimilation. I like problems that are at the interface of mechanistic and data-driven modeling. I believe in performing research that adresses real and specific problems. I love learning about various subject matter, and I have enjoyed learning about microbiology and microecology from incredibly smart people.
