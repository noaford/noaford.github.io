Welcome to my website! I'm an applied mathmetician working on computational problems. I will use this site to write about what I'm working on and problems I'm thinking about. These problems will range from fluid dynamics, diffusive processes, high performance computing, and even some machine learning. Check out my blog to see what I'm working on now!

Below is an image depicting oxygen concentration in a two-dimensional flow cell with biofilm growing on the surfaces of the flow cell. Fluid is entering through the gaps on the right and flowing out the bottom.
