Welcome to my website! I'm an applied mathematician working on developing and evaluating autonomous systems. My current work focuses on using Imitation Learning and Explainable AI to evaluate autonomies. I'm interested in how we can better understand new technologies that are increasingly powering autonomous systems, such as foundation models, and how we can use this knowledge to improve autonomous applications.
