Hi everyone. I'm an applied mathematician working on computational problems. I would like to both log my work and share what I'm doing with other people. I plan to share thoughts, strategies, ideas, and some code when I can. Hopefully you enjoy following my process of learning new things and maybe you will even get something interesting out of it.



<!--- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %} --->
