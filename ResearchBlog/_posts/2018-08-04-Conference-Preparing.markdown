Next week I'm giving a presentation at SIAM Life Sciences 2018 as part of a mini symposium  on biofilm. I will be talking about the model I’ve been developing that’s on the scale of the biofilm flow cell. It’s a numerical scheme that uses asymptotic results to solve for flow substrate concentration level and growth throughout a flow cell.

The general idea is to break a two-dimensional flow cell into a whole bunch of one-dimensional profiles to calculated the flux of substrate into the biofilm. The 1D slices put together describe the whole domain. Then growth is calculated using the concentration calculated near the biofilm layer. I also do this for three dimensions. 

The SIAM Conference will be the first time I present my work to a group larger than my a few colleagues from my department. I’m definitely nervous, but I think my slides are really good, so that should help the presentation to go more smoothly.
