Over winter break I presented my biofilm project (in the form of a poster) at Dynamics Days (2019) in Evanston, IL. Other than the obvious pleasure of not having to travel for a conference, I really liked hearing about different dynamical systems that people are working on in different fields: everything from neuroscience to geoscience to epidemiology.

Before the conference I was able to fix a couple problems I was having with the code. I am now relatively comfortable with my understanding of what my model represents and how it behaves. The model exhibits voltage oscilations which begin near the center of the biofilm (due to starvation) and propogate outward until the whole biofilm hyperpolarizes (colored as blue). These oscillations occur periodically as the interior starves. I like the image below because it shows the voltage potential and growth over time.
